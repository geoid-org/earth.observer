## Introduction


Welcome to **Earth Observer**, the most comprehensive digital compendium of our planet's vast and diverse landscapes, atmospheric phenomena, and human influences. Earth Observer stands at the crossroads of scientific research, technological innovation, and a growing societal awareness of the intricacies of our planet.

Our planet is a magnificent sphere of life, an ecosystem of interconnected elements from land to sea, ice caps to skies, geologic terrains to human civilizations. Each of these elements tells a story, reveals a pattern, and holds a key to understanding our environment and our place within it. From the impact of natural disasters to the nuanced changes in climate patterns, from the delineation of land use to the tracking of sea-level rise, understanding these global phenomena requires a multi-dimensional perspective that is both expansive in scope and precise in detail.

Enter **Earth Observer**, your go-to directory for the vast world of spatial data sources that cover these myriad aspects. With data pooled from highly reputable sources such as the US Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS), Earth Observer opens a gateway to unparalleled understanding of our planet.

Moreover, Earth Observer also harnesses the power of open-source data, granting access to a multitude of spatial data from the European Union's Open Data Portal and other similar sources. This wealth of information enables researchers, scientists, policymakers, educators, and the public at large to observe, study, and interpret the multifaceted nature of Earth and its environment.

Whether you're an environmental scientist in need of satellite imagery for your research, a city planner looking for topographic data for land-use planning, or simply a curious mind fascinated by the mysteries of our planet, **Earth Observer** is your trusted companion on this exploratory journey.

Visit us at [www.earth.observer](https://www.earth.observer) to start your exploration. The story of Earth is in your hands - it's time to observe, understand, and act.

**Earth Observer** is a directory of spatial data sources that cover our planet’s terrestrial landscapes, oceans and seas, frozen ice caps, atmosphere and clouds, geologic terrains, topography, nautical charts, natural hazards, human impacts, and many other earth and environmental science topics.

There are several directories of spatial data sources that cover various aspects of the Earth's terrain, oceans, atmosphere, and more. These sources can be used for a wide range of applications, including environmental science, geographic information systems (GIS), disaster management, and land-use planning. Some examples of data sources include the US Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the European Space Agency (ESA), and NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS). These sources provide access to a wide range of data, including satellite imagery, topographic maps, weather forecasts, and geological surveys. Additionally, there are also a number of open data portals, such as the Open Data Portal of the European Union, that provide free access to spatial data from various sources.

## Development

### Authors

**Earth Observer** is an open-source project by **[Geoid](https://www.geoid.org "Geoid website")**.

**Geoid is a spatial operating system that covers our entire planet with an extended intelligent dimension.**
This self-organizing network bridges our virtual and physical environments and is formed by all the people of our planet and the information and communication technologies that connect them. Geoid functions as a nervous system that mediates the data we produce and use in our daily lives, adds value to interconnectivity and cherishes spontaneous connections between people and the places and things they love.
