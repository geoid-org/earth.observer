# Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model, Sea Surface Elevation

The Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) is a data-assimilative hybrid isopycnal-sigma-pressure (generalized) coordinate ocean model. The subset of HYCOM data hosted in EE contains the variables salinity, temperature, velocity, and elevation. They have been interpolated to a uniform 0.08 degree lat/long grid between 80.48°S and 80.48°N. The salinity, temperature, and velocity variables have been interpolated to 40 standard z-levels.
