# Cross-blended Hypsometric Tints

Shaded relief combined with custom elevation colors based on climateâ€”humid lowlands are green and arid lowlands brown. As in nature, the map colors gradually blend into one another across regions (x and y axis) and from lowlands to highlands (z axis), hence the name cross-blended hypsometric tints.
