# Forest and Buildings removed Copernicus DEM

Following public release of the Copernicus GLO-30 DEM last year, lead researchers from the University of Bristol and Fathom have used machine learning to remove buildings and forests from the Copernicus Digital Elevation Model. This has produced, for the first time, a global map of elevation with buildings and forests removed at 1 arc second (âˆ¼30 m) grid spacing.
