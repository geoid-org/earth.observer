# Bioregions 2020 Framework

The Bioregions 2020 framework is organized by the world's major biogeographical realms, the broadest divisions of Earth's land surface in which ecosystems and groupings of organisms share a common evolutionary history. These roughly correspond to the major continents of the Earth but are further subdivided. For example, the Neotropical realm is divided into Central America and Southern America. One Earth utilizes these 14 realm divisions – further divided into 52 subrealms, 185 bioregions, and 844 ecoregions – as a framework to better understand the natural world that surrounds us.
