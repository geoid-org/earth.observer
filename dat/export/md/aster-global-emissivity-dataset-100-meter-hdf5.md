# ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset 100 meter HDF5

The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Emissivity Database (ASTER-GED) was developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of Technology. This product includes the mean emissivity and standard deviation for all 5 ASTER Thermal Infrared bands, mean land surface temperature (LST) and standard deviation, a re-sampled ASTER GDEM, land-water mask, mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and standard deviation, and observation count.
