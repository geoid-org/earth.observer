# Cshapes

CShapes 2.0 maps the borders and capitals of independent states and dependent territories from 1886 to 2019. There are two versions of the dataset, which are based on the Gleditsch and Ward (1999) or the Correlates of War coding of independent states. Border changes were coded based on the Territorial Change Dataset by Tir et al (1998), the Encyclopedia of International Boundaries by Biger (1995) and the Encyclopedia of African Boundaries by Brownlie (1979). The dataset can be downloaded in various formats and is also accessible through the CShapes R package.
