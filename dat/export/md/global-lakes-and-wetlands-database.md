# Global Lakes and Wetlands Database

The Global Lakes and Wetlands Database combines data from the best available sources for lakes and wetlands on a global scale at three coordinated levels - large lakes and reservoirs, smaller water bodies, and wetlands. The application of GIS functionality enables the generation of a database which focuses in three coordinated levels: large lakes and reservoirs (Level 1), smaller water bodies (Level 2), and wetlands (Level 3).
