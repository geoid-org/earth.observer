# Global Wind Atlas

The Global Wind Atlas (GWA) primarily supports wind power development during the exploration and preliminary wind resource assessment phases prior to the installation of meteorology measurement stations on site. It also serves as a useful tool for governments to get a better understanding of their wind resource potential at provincial and local levels.
