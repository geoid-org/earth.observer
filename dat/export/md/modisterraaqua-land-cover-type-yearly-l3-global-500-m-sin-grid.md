# MODIS/Terra+Aqua Land Cover Type Yearly L3 Global 500 m SIN Grid

The MCD12Q1 V6 product provides global land cover types at yearly intervals (2001-2016) derived from six different classification schemes. It is derived using supervised classifications of MODIS Terra and Aqua reflectance data. The supervised classifications then undergo additional post-processing that incorporate prior knowledge and ancillary information to further refine specific classes.
