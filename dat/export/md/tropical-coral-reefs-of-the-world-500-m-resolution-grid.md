# Tropical Coral Reefs of the World (500-m resolution grid)

Generalized grid data set reflecting coral reef locations at 500 m resolution. Reef locations are based on 500 meter resolution gridded data reflecting shallow, tropical coral reefs of the world. Organizations contributing to the data and development of the map include the Institute for Marine Remote Sensing, University of South Florida (IMaRS/USF), Institut de Recherche pour le DÃ©veloppement (IRD), UNEP-WCMC, The World Fish Center, and WRI. The composite data set was compiled from multiple sources, incorporating products from the Millennium Coral Reef Mapping Project prepared by IMaRS/USF and IRD.
