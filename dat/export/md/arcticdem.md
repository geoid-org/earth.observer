Detailed elevation models of all land areas greater than 60 degrees north, generated using photogrammetry from high-res satellite images. ArcticDEM is an NGA-NSF initiative to automatically produce a high-resolution, high quality, digital surface model (DSM) of the Arctic using optical stereo imagery, high-performance computing, and open source photogrammetry software.
