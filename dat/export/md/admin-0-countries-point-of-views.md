# Admin 0 – Countries point-of-views

These optional point-of-view (POV) variants show the worldview for several dozen countries according to de jure boundaries (as prescribed by the home country’s law and/or local conventions) and their global alliances. This results in between 246 and 258 countries, depending on who’s counting, with variation in border alignments.
