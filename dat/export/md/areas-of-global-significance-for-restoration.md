# Areas of Global Significance for Restoration

This map shows the preliminary results of a global prioritization analysis for the restoration of habitats for terrestrial species and carbon sequestering. Species data used in the analysis consisted in fine-scale distributions maps of more than 180000 terrestrial vertebrate and plant species globally. These data were then refined by removing unsuitable areas using information on species' habitat preferences and species' known altitudinal limits or, where unknown, by removing anthropogenically modified land. Given existing biases in taxonomic coverage for plant species, we calculated for the analysis in total 10 representative sets of species, containing approximately 10% of species of each taxonomic group.
